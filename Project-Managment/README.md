Project Management Dashboard — Power BI

Overview

This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of project performance across departments, regions, and managers.
It helps organizations monitor progress, evaluate financial efficiency, and make data-driven decisions based on real insights.

Problem Statement

Companies often manage large numbers of projects simultaneously, but they lack a unified view that clearly shows:
 • Project completion rates
 • Cost vs. benefit
 • Department and manager performance
 • Region-based project distribution
 • Overall project complexity

Without this visibility, decision-makers struggle to identify bottlenecks, allocate resources effectively, and optimize project outcomes.

Solution

A centralized Power BI dashboard was developed to combine all project data into one interactive and easy-to-read report.
The dashboard allows users to:
 • Track project progress in real time
 • Compare performance across departments and managers
 • Analyze financial metrics (cost vs. benefit)
 • Understand trends by month
 • Monitor project complexity and workload distribution

This solution enhances clarity and supports more efficient decision-making.

 Tools Used
 • Power BI
 • Power Query (Data Cleaning)
 • DAX (Measures & Calculations)
 • Data Modeling
