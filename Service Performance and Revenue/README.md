Service Performance and Revenue Dashboard — Power BI

 Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a clear and interactive analysis of service revenue across departments, regions, quarters, and clients.
It helps business teams understand where revenue is coming from, which regions perform best, and how revenue trends change over time.

 Problem Statement

Organizations that handle multiple service lines often struggle to:
 • Identify which departments generate the highest revenue

 • Compare performance by department
 • Visualize regional revenue contribution
